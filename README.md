Want to be able to deploy code challenges on chain and 
execute them via transactions. You should get rep for 
writing code that passes the tests. Decentralized hackerrank/leetcode.

Milestones:
- Use ganach-cli as an rpc endpoint to start (later use test networks)
- Deploy a dummy contract to ganach 
- See if it is possible to actually execute some code in a contract on chain in the first place.
Not entirely sure how to do this. First step could be have some test cases hard coded in 
a contract, then spawn a new contract based on the input which self destructs after the "execution" of the user's
input code.
